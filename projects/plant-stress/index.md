## Project Overview
Multi-omics integration studying stress responses in rice, focusing on:
- Hi-C for enhancer-promoter interactions
- ChIP-seq for histone modifications
- RNA-seq for gene expression
- Network analysis and integration

### Current Phase
[Automated status from Pomodoro phases]

### Core Components
- Data Processing Pipeline
  * Quality control
  * Reference alignment
  * Peak calling
  * Contact matrix generation
- Analysis Framework
  * Differential expression
  * Network construction (WGCNA)
  * Multi-omics integration
  * Pathway analysis
